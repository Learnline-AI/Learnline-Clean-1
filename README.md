### API Endpoints

The service provides a REST API for programmatic access:

- `GET /api/status` - Service status and configuration
- `GET /api/languages` - Supported languages information
- `GET /api/history?limit=50` - Recent transcriptions
- `DELETE /api/history` - Clear transcription history
- `POST /api/export/json` - Export as JSON
- `POST /api/export/text` - Export as text file

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure:

```bash
# Core Settings
RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT=true
DEFAULT_LANGUAGE=en
SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES=en,hi,hi-en

# Performance
MAX_AUDIO_QUEUE_SIZE=30
PIPELINE_LATENCY=0.5
WEB_CONCURRENCY=1

# Logging
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

### Railway-Specific Configuration

The application is optimized for Railway's platform:

- **Memory Usage**: Optimized for 512MB-1GB RAM limits
- **CPU Processing**: Uses CPU-only PyTorch for compatibility
- **Health Checks**: Automatic monitoring at `/api/status`
- **Logging**: Structured logging for Railway's log aggregation
- **Build Optimization**: Multi-stage Docker build for efficiency

## üìã Deployment Files

This repository includes production-ready deployment configurations:

- **`railway.json`**: Railway service configuration with health checks and environment setup
- **`nixpacks.toml`**: Build configuration optimized for Python and audio processing
- **`Procfile`**: Process configuration for web service startup
- **`Dockerfile`**: Multi-stage Docker build for Railway deployment
- **`.env.example`**: Complete environment variable template

## üéØ Language Support

### Supported Languages

1. **English (`en`)**: Full English transcription with optimized models
2. **Hindi (`hi`)**: Native Hindi transcription with Devanagari script support  
3. **Hindi-English (`hi-en`)**: Code-switching between Hindi and English within the same conversation

### Language Switching

- Change languages dynamically during active sessions
- Automatic language detection for mixed conversations
- Optimized models for each language pair
- Seamless switching without connection interruption

## üìä Monitoring and Troubleshooting

### Health Monitoring

Railway automatically monitors your deployment:

- **Health Check**: `/api/status` endpoint verification
- **Memory Usage**: Tracked and logged for optimization
- **Connection Count**: WebSocket connection monitoring
- **Response Times**: Automatic performance tracking

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

1. **High Memory Usage**:
   - Reduce `MAX_AUDIO_QUEUE_SIZE` in environment variables
   - Monitor `/api/status` for memory statistics
   - Check Railway logs for memory warnings

2. **Transcription Delays**:
   - Increase `PIPELINE_LATENCY` for stability
   - Check network connectivity
   - Verify microphone permissions

3. **Language Detection Issues**:
   - Speak clearly with pauses between sentences
   - Use appropriate language settings
   - Check audio quality and background noise

#### Log Analysis

Access Railway logs to troubleshoot:

```bash
# Railway CLI
railway logs

# Or access via Railway dashboard
```

Look for:
- Memory usage warnings
- WebSocket connection status
- Transcription processing times
- Error messages and stack traces

### Performance Optimization

1. **Memory Management**:
   - Monitor memory usage in Railway dashboard
   - Adjust queue sizes based on usage patterns
   - Clear transcription history regularly

2. **Latency Optimization**:
   - Use appropriate `PIPELINE_LATENCY` settings
   - Optimize network connectivity
   - Consider regional deployment for global users

3. **Audio Quality**:
   - Use good quality microphone
   - Minimize background noise
   - Speak clearly with appropriate volume
